JMO_Spectrum library
_____________________________

We deal routinely with spectra in illumination optics. We need to analyze LED spectra, compute color coordinates and color rendering values from spectra, integrate them, add spectra, multiply spectra with scalar weights and with other spectra (like transmission spectra), interpolate a given measured spectrum with non-equidistant wavelength values to a regular 1 nm array, and so on.
In practice, this is tedious: spectra come in various formats, and the problem of dealing with two spectra als tabulated values which have two different sets of wavelengths is annoying.
This open source Matlab library is designed to make these engineering tasks easy and transparent. It is partly compatible with GNU Octave, and should be fully compatible with Matlab for Mac and Linux.
